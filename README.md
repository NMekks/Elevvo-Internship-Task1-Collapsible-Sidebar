# Collapsible Sidebar Project

A modern, fully responsive collapsible sidebar built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The sidebar features smooth animations and is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, providing an intuitive user experience across all devices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smooth Animations:** The sidebar uses CSS transitions for a fluid sliding animation.
- **Single Button Toggle:** A single hamburger button opens and closes the menu, creating a clean and intuitive UX.
- **Icon Centering:** On desktop, navigation icons center themselves elegantly when the sidebar is collapsed.
- **Fully Responsive:**
  - **Desktop:** The sidebar pushes the main content to the side.
  - **Mobile:** The sidebar slides in from the left of the screen.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Built with 100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries required.
- **Clean Code:** Organized into separate, well-commented files for easy understanding and maintenance.
